        <h2>Career Objective</h2>
        <p>What I hope to achieve in the future, once graduating from Queen’s University Belfast with a 
            bachelor’s degree in computing and Informational Technologies is to go straight into working for a 
            high-level computing company with a renowned post graduate scheme. I am unsure what field in 
            computer technologies interests me the most yet as I am still learning the vast array of opportunities 
            from this program, but what I have experienced from personal reading I have been able to see and 
            understand how this course will open many pathways including specialising in databases, cyber 
            security and working with computer hardware. I wish to get as much experience in my field as 
            possible. by working for multiple companies, I hope to achieve this. Once I am fully established in my 
            field of desire, I aspire to be working with a company whose ideologies align with my own. It is 
            important to me to be working for a company that gives its employees opportunities to travel, learn 
            and move up within the ranks of the global industry.</p>

        <h2>University Projects</h2>
        <p>During Web Technologies last year I was assigned to a group for an assignment, I had to create one 
            out of four parts to a game. My stage was coded using HTML, java and java script. I met up with my 
            group on multiple occasions as we had to check we were all progressing at the same rate. This was to 
            ensure that every stage would be ready at the same time so that we could test are game and make 
            tweaks to the game when necessary. In the end we had achieved 57% as a group for that assignment. 
            I had also made a CV using html and CSS in web technologies to display my website designing skills in 
            which I received 70% for my work. </p>
